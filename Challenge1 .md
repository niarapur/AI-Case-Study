# AI Adoption in the Real estate Industry -  Zillow Group's Domination fueled by AI  


## Introduction

>Zillow- a name that as is synonymous to home searches as Google is to all other searches,  was incorporated in 2006 and is based out of Seattle,WA. This small but mighty player encompasses multiple brands under its umbrella, including Zillow Premier Agent, Zillow Home Loans, Zillow Rentals, Trulia, StreetEasy, HotPads, and Out East. Zillow was founded by ex microsoft executives:
Richard Barton
> - Lloyd Frank
> - Spencer Rascoff
> - Kirstin Acker
>   
> Barton and Frank previously founded ***Expedia***, one of the primary sites in use today to buy airline tickets. A 2014 interview with Barton describes the driving thought behind his success - constantly asking the question : *** What piece of marketplace information do people crave and don't have?*** (*1- Ny Times article The Art of Something from Nothing" April,13-2014*). The answers to this led to key service product launches like Expedia for airline tickets, Glassdoor for employee reviews and Zillow- an attempt to increase transparency and ease of managing an end-to -end real-estate transaction. Key customers for this service include home buyers, home sellers, selling and buying Agents, mortgage customers and sellers and real estate based advertising firms.

>## The Business Model
> Zillow's primary function is to  connect a homebuyer with sellers though its website/app and facilitate a sale. It has now become a marketplace where buyers and sellers can access services like appointing Real estate agents, getting a home loan (Zillow Home Loans) and getting access to closing services. Zillow brings in customers by combining:
> - publicly available MLS listings with their proprietary real-estate analysis of the area
> - A valuation of the estimated cost the house (Zestimate)
> - Pricing trends over time
> - Real estate agent information.
>
> ## The Revenue Model
>Zillow's revenue is driven by ***offering advertising*** on Zillow.com and the mobile app, offering leads to paying Real-estate agents (called Zillow Premier Agents) and ***selling leads to Mortgage firms*** who tap into Zillow's customers to advertise their products.
>Additional minor revenue sources include:
> - Interest from Zillow Mortgages
> - Revenue from rentals
> - Commissions on closing services
>Zillow is one of the most visited real-estate websites. Zillow's 1st quarter reported ***2.3 billion visits*** , that grew 3% compared to last year. It is estimated that 70% of all customers in the US, who transact in residential real estate visit and use Zillow ( 2023 Zillow Annual report). While the numbers are staggering in terms of a customer base- Zillow is yet to turn a profit. Zillow's 2023 revenue was $1.95Bn and operated with a net loss of $158MM (Yahoo Finance Ticker ZG).
>## AI At Zillow
>One of the key differentiators that contributed to Zillow's early success in capturing this market was its investment into AI. Zillow's proprietary  ML generated home valuation - the Zestimate, is at the core of this. Prominently displayed on a majority of home listings, the Zestimate value predicts the value of the home after considering  vast databases available including home evaluations, county data, recent home sales and public interest in the property to name a few. The most interesting aspect of the Zestimate is that it is built from a lot of publicly available information, augmented with information entered by homeowners/sellers. With the Zestimate - Zillow opened the doors to increased investment in AI based tools. Zillow has a robust infrastructure and investment to support AI growth
